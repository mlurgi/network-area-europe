This repository contains the source code used to produce the results presented in our paper entitled:

'The spatial scaling of food web structure across European biogeographical regions'

Published in Ecography on February 2021 - https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.05229

In this file I describe the contents of the repository and provide a brief description of what source file does when executed.

To execute the scripts successfully, place all the scripts, folders, and data files contained in this repository within the same folder.

The R scripts included in this project are:

1.- 'european-network-area-relationships.r': This script implements different map cells aggregation algorithms to simulate increases in spatial scales across Europe and calculates food web properties on the food web determined by the species present in each given area. To do this it manipulates species distribution maps and a meta-network (metaweb) of trophic interactions constructed at the European regional scale.

2.- 'null_model.r': This script implements two null models for the construction of network area relationships (NARs) across space for comparison with the output from the original data analysed. The script calculates the same properties as in 'european-network-area-relationships.r' but using two different null models: (1) based on the number of species for the corresponding area, a subset of the metaweb is selected containing that number of species; and (2) based on the same number of species and links from the corresponding area, a random graph is created containing the same number of vertices and edges as specified by these species and links.

In addition to the main script, another source code file containing helper functions is provided to support calculations of food web properties: utils.r. A data file is also provided to facilitate running of the script, test-data.rda, which contains a sample of the data used for the analysis. The folders BiogeoRegions2016_shapefile and mask10k are also provided for completeness. These are needed to retrieve the spatial data necessary to build communities and networks across the European geographical extent.

I hope you enjoy the code!
